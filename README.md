# CodewarsSolutions
A repo for me to add my solutions to Codewars kata, and invite comments on them. 

- I was introduced to Codewars through the application process of a coding school, and quickly was drawn into its gameified featureset
- Primary focuses are readbility, brevity and runtime (as well as good best practice)
- The KYU mentioned in the files refers to difficulty levels. Higher KYUs are considered more challenging
- Would love feedback on all my solutions
